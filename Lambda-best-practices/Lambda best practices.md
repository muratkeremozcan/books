# Lambda best practices

## Performance

### Tuning function memory

https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/

Lambda memory allocation is the only way to control the performance and cost of our functions.

We do not want to do manual tuning, but take advantage of the below utils. Identify the sweet spot for you needs. It's a cost vs execution time decision.

1. [aws-lambda-power-tuning project](https://github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning)

2. [Lumigo CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lumigo-cli). Install via NPM by running "npm i -g lumigo-cli". Pick speed, balance or cost as strategy.

### What's in a cold start?

[Provisioned Concurrency - the end of cold starts](https://lumigo.io/blog/provisioned-concurrency-the-end-of-cold-starts/#:~:text=Once%20enabled%2C%20Provisioned%20Concurrency%20will,at%20lunch%20and%20dinner%20time.) : Once enabled, Provisioned Concurrency will keep your desired number of concurrent executions initialized and ready to respond to requests. This means an end to cold starts! Use it when you can't tolerate any cold starts because it has trade offs.

You can use the Lumigo cli to analyze code start duration of your functions.

### What effects the initialization time

Memory allocation doesn't effect initialization time during cold start. Click [here](https://medium.com/@hichaelmart/shave-99-93-off-your-lambda-bill-with-this-one-weird-trick-33c0acebb2ea) for Michael Hart's article.

It's faster to load dependencies from a layer, vs the deployment artifact.

Unused dependencies do not add to initialization time, but they can hurt your regional cold storage limit. Use [lambda-janitor](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/us-east-1/374852340823/lambda-janitor) for that to delete the old versions of your lambda.

The main optimization you can do to improve cold start is having less dependencies in your lambda handler code; require explicitly vs the whole package.

### Measuring cold start performance

You can initiate a lambda on the AWS console once, and then another time to measure the cold start time. Change an environment variable to reset cold starts. To scale cold start measurement we can use Lumigo cli.
